## Sauerbraten WC NG ##

## Latest Release: ##

You can download the latest release here: [wc-ng.mooo.com](https://wc-ng.mooo.com/).

### Installation: ###

* Client:
    * Windows:
        * Installation on Windows is quite easy, all you have to do is to run the installer.  
        * You don't need to backup anything, as the installer won't replace your original  
          client. You can run both, the original and our client at the same time.  
        * The installer attempts to find the installation path automatically, if it fails  
          (e.g. your sauer comes from svn, then point it to your sauerbraten installation path).  
        * Once installing is done, you'll have new shortcuts on your desktop and startmenu.  
        * Start the client by clicking on the "Sauerbraten_wc" shortcut.
    * Linux:
        * Open your preferred file manager (e.g. konqueror, dolphin, nautilus, etc.)  
          or terminal and browse to ~/.sauerbraten.  
        * Copy the doc, data, packages and plugins folders into the previous opened dir.  
        * Browse to the location of the original sauerbraten binary  
          (e.g. /usr/lib/games/sauerbraten/).  
        * Rename the binary to sauerbraten_orig and copy the wc executeable into this dir.  
    * OS X:
        * Open another finder window, go to your home folder and then browse to  
          Library / Application Support / sauerbraten.  
        * Copy the doc, data, packages and plugins folders from the opened wc.dmg into the  
          previous opened dir.  
        * Browse to the location of the original sauerbraten package, right click it,  
          choose "Show Package Contents" and browse to contents / MacOS.  
        * Rename (backup) the original file sauerbraten_u (OS X 10.6+) or sauerbraten_c (OS X 10.5)  
          to sauerbraten_orig and the wclient executeable from the opened wc.dmg into this dir.  
        * Now rename it to either sauerbraten_u (OS X 10.6+) or sauerbraten_c (OS X 10.5).  

* Menu:

    * Windows:
        * Open Windows Explorer and navigate to  
          C:\Users\<your username>\Documents\My Games\Sauerbraten or  
          startmenu->documents->My Games->Sauerbraten.  
        * Copy the content of the zip archive into this directory.  
        * Add exec config/main.cfg to your autoexec.cfg (create it, if it doesn't exit)
    * Linux:
        * Open your preferred file manager (e.g. konqueror, dolphin, nautilus, etc.)  
          or terminal and browse to ~/.sauerbraten.
        * Copy the content of the zip archive into this directory.  
        * Add exec config/main.cfg to your autoexec.cfg (create it, if it doesn't exit).
    * OS X:
        * Open finder and navigate to ~/Library/Application Support/sauerbraten  
          On 10.7+ you need to make the Library folder visible first, checkout: link  
        * Copy the content of the zip archive into the previous opened directory.  
        * Add exec config/main.cfg to your autoexec.cfg (create it, if it doesn't exit).
