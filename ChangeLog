Some features had to be dropped due to a persons arrogancy (you may imagine
whom it is). I have tried everything to solve this, but he didn't answer to my
emails over several months(!) (claiming they were "lost", while I wrote to three
email addresses), didn't appear on IRC to said times to solve the code licensing
issue (and now, while I write this, he is ignoring my emails again).

So, I have enough of this, and I don't want to deal such a person any longer.

If there is enough interested, then I might rewrite wanted features that have
been dropped but not replaced yet.

Rewritten features:
- Plugin API
- Console History
- indentfrags
- Several other things (including internal used functions)

Removed features:
- Plugins: movieencoder, soundinput and mpdclient
- '/consearch'
- '/checkregex' (wanted to get rid of pcre)
- chatsounds
- name completion / highlighting
- \fz and \fb color codes
- Center Console  (May be rewritten if there's enough interest)
- '/contimecolor' + '/conshowtime'
- '/colornames' + '/highlightteamkillmsg' (TKs are already highlighted with \f6)

Deprecated commands:
- addplugin(s)   (new name is loadplugin(s))
- delplugins(s)  (new name is unloadplugin(s))
- listplugins    (new name is listloadedplugins)

Things that have not been rewritten on purpose:
- showtimeleft:  the source code for this was already given out to others
